I’ve been doing Data Science projects for awhile, using the core libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn… the list goes on. While I still use all of their documentation for reference, I have yet to dive deep and look at how some of those imports or their pre-built algorithms work.
below I’ll go over:
Why I chose to do K-means
Links to how I built it and how it traditionally works
How my version worked verses sklearns version
